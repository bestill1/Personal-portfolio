                    <p> About Me </p>
                    <p> Greetings all my name is Gwendolyn Smith, aka Ms. Gwen
                        to most.</p>
                
                    <p> I'm a (Golden Senior) with 12 years into my retirement, I have a son, raised 1 daughter as  my own, I have (3) grands by my son, (2) by my daughter. Now as a Golden Gal, I'm venturing  
                        out to explore coding and web designing. I worked 30 years at Nabisco, I held varies jobs titles such as a bagger, machine operator, processor, and a company teamLeader. I was also a Union Steward, and Union Representative for my Local Union 300.</p>
                
                    <p> I have plenty of experience in the volunteer arena, especially within the hospitals, some clinics, etc. I worked mostly in Chicago Illinois, before relocating. I have done some poetry writing, I have (2) books in the U.S. Copyright Office. Now I am working at becoming a Jr. Web Design Developer, where I can learn to design different fazes of art, with will help me to showcase my work, which I would love to include in my poetry.</p>
                
                
                    <p> These designs will help me to share the heart and soul of my work. I think that it's important to let others see the different ways one can express themselves through coding and web development designs. I'm willing to take this leap of faith, as I refocus on showing and sharing my new found adventure in becoming a Jr. Web Developer</p>
